            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>An ANSWER to a late Pamphlet, Intituled,</hi> A Short Scheme of the Uſurpations of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE World may very juſtly wonder at ſevera paſſages in this ill-deſigned, and as ill-writ Pamphlet, which the Author has taken the pains to collect from ſome petty <hi>Grubſtreet</hi> Chronicle. <hi>Henry</hi> II. is call'd an Uſurper (<hi>pag.</hi> 4.) becauſe he accepted of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> in his Mothers Life-time; tho' by her not oppoſing his claim, it may very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be concluded, that ſhe freely conſented to his promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the moſt effectual means to ſecure the Crown to her Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>
            <p>But we are told, that a Crown is no Eſtate to be made over in Truſt: if our Author's meaning is, that a Crown is an Eſtate which the Poſſeſſor cannot diveſt himſelf of by a voluntary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, both Reaſon, and a multitude of examples in ſeveral Ages, and Nations, prove that the Principle our Author has laid down, is founded on a groſs miſtake. Therefore if our Author deſigns to publiſh any more Schemes of Uſurpation, let him firſt inform us what it is, and how far it extends, leſt the World ſhould accuſe him of having as notoriouſly uſurped to himſelf the Title of a Writer, as any of our Princes ever did the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> He would perſwade his Readers to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God puniſh't King <hi>Edward</hi> III. and King <hi>Henry</hi> V. for their Uſurpations, with frequent and unexpected Victories, in the acquiſition of which, tho' there was ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood ſhed (as it was impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe) yet the Enemies paid an exceſſive price for it; after the defeat of their great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the Impriſonment of their King, they being forced to buy their Peace upon ſuch Terms, as our conquering Uſurpers pleaſed to impoſe. Nor did ever any well-wiſher to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation deny, that theſe Two Princes were the Glory of their

Age, and of our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory. If I ſhould reckon up all the evident miſtakes and falſe inferences in this Libel, it would be too tedious, ſince a careleſs Eye cannot eaſily overlook them.</p>
            <p>If the Pamphlet finds ſo undeſerved a reception in the World as to need a Second Impreſſion, the Author is deſired to add to it this <hi>Poſtſcript;</hi> which being founded on the Principles aſſerted by him, will ſhew the World that he hath wilfully, and perhaps partially forborn to ſpeak of as notorious an Uſurper, as any that are mentioned in his Scheme.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Off-ſpring of an Inceſtuous Marriage, had no other unqueſtionable Divine Right to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> than what was given her by an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> made in her Father's Reign, and the common conſent of the Nobility and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after the Death of her Brother King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. whoſe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the Crown by Letters Patents under the Great Seal, being directly contrary to the former entail of it, limited by a higher Authority: his Siſter, the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> was acknowledged Queen. Therefore, according to our Authors abſtruſe Notions, She (as well as her Grand-father <hi>Henry</hi> VII.) muſt be reckoned among the Uſurpers of the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Let us now ſee what ſucceſs attended her, and whether the Nation was happy under her Government. As ſoon as She ſaw her ſelf fixed in the Throne, She impriſoned and deprived ſeveral of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Biſhops, contrary to the then Eſtabliſh't Laws of the Realm: She intruded <hi>Popiſh</hi> Biſhops into the Sees, thus declared vacant; the ſmall remainder of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Biſhops, who had been called to <hi>Parliament</hi> by Writ, were, nevertheleſs, violently thruſt out of the <hi>Parliament-Houſe,</hi> for refuſing to Worſhip the Maſs. The Members of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> in her <hi>Firſt Parliament,</hi> were choſen by <hi>force</hi> and <hi>threats:</hi> the Freeholders were hindred by <hi>violence</hi> from exerciſing their right of chuſing <hi>Repreſentatives:</hi> falſe <hi>returns</hi> were made; and thoſe who were for the Reformed Religion, tho' duly elected, were by <hi>force</hi> expelled the Houſe. So that we cannot wonder at the Statutes made in this pretended <hi>Free Parliament;</hi> which was in every thing influenced by the

Court-Party. Shortly after, her Marriage with the haughty jealous <hi>Spaniard</hi> (of which She her ſelf felt the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences) was juſtly diſliked by the Nobility and Commonalty. Her baſe deſign of ſetting up a ſuppoſitious Child for the Heir to the Crown, was not only happily defeated, but deſervedly expoſed to the cenſure of the Nation: Her Deſign to erect the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition</hi> in <hi>England</hi> was diſappoined. <hi>Calais</hi> (after having belonged to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> about Two hundred and Eleven Years, and which was gained with great difficulty, after Eleven Months Siege) was in the depth of Winter loſt in a Weeks time: and quickly after, all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Territories were with ſmall difficulty recovered by the <hi>French.</hi> We muſt not forget how exactly She put in practice the baſe, treacherous, and deſtructive Principles of the pretended <hi>Catholic Religion,</hi> in theſe remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble particulars. She barbarouſly uſed her only Siſter, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and deſigned to have taken away her Life, for no other cauſe, but her firm adherence to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> She impriſoned and burnt Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſheltered her from her Fathers fury; She deprived and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned Judge <hi>Hales,</hi> who alone reſolutely oppoſed King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Sixth's Will; and preferred Judge <hi>Bromley</hi> to be Lord Chief Juſtice, tho' he had without any reluctancy prepared the Letters-Patents for her Excluſion. The Inhabitants of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who were the firſt that took up Arms for her (upon her Promiſe to permit them the Exerciſe of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) were the firſt that ſuffered perſecution under her. And after She had put to Death near Three hundred perſons (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to Quality, Age, or Sex,) it pleaſed God to put an end to the <hi>Romiſh Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> by her unexpected and unlamented Death. Nor is her Memory preſerved from Oblivion by any thing, but her repeated acts of <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</hi> This was the ſucceſs that attended her, this the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Liberty, the Religion eſtabliſht in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, during her five Years Tyranny.</p>

            <p>That I may not detain the Reader any longer, I will con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clude this advice to our Learned <hi>Pamphleteer;</hi> That for the fu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture he do not ſo poſitively aſcribe all unhappy accidents, a frequent Wars, and Rebellions, the Effuſion of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood the unfortunate end of ſome of our Princes, to the Divine Vengeance upon them, for the Uſurpations he accuſes them of ſince, if he will conſult our Hiſtorians, he may find that <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> II. <hi>Richard</hi> II. and the Incomparable Prince, King <hi>Charles</hi> I. tho' their Title from <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror is indiſputable, were far unhappier than any of the Uſurpers he mentions. That in <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth's, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Reign, a great deal of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood was ſhed both at home and abroad, tho' their right was unqueſtionable, and univerſally acknowledged. And that as to the promiſcuous good or ill ſucceſs of all Affairs in this lower World, the obſervation of the Wiſeſt of Princes, and of Men, is very often exactly verified. There is one event to the Righteous and to the Wicked: To the Prince who aſcends the Throne by an unqueſtionable Right, and to him that aſcends it by Violence and Uſurpation. To the Prince that religiouſly performs the Solemn Oath taken at his Coronation, and to him that wilfully breaks through all the Obligations he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and endeavours by the moſt baſe Methods to diſſolve the Eſtabliſht Government.</p>
